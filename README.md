# Why-are-you-here
So i made this little game, I want to see what people think about it,I respect all reviews, you answer only with "yes" or "no", the text between ** is said by the narrator, this is just an alpha, I am trying to put this gane into Renpy, I hope it will work
EDIT:
Soooo, that Python game didn't seem fun did it, well I made a visual novel out of it in Renpy, cheers, it's short, like 5 minutes based on your answers, but try to do all endings. Have fun
